jsx IS NOT HTML AT ALL!!!
 its a react option.
effictint, cuz saved in virtual dom, and only updates with changes
npx- get it without installing it. 
1-npx create react app
run eject script to get out of react scriptd for very sophisticated projects
a function can give you tonz of jsx to render
components js html and data and veiw pacgaged up to one reusable cimoonent
function ans class use capital
class extends react.cimpononeb=tnts
info flows down, kids cant change  it. name=joe
state 8:27
lifecycle motheod
componentDidMount() to dom,  its show time
componentWillUnmount() going away

if just making a state, you x need a constructor
its life is onky as long as it there, if unmounts, its dead. you''ll get a new one
es7 react/reduxgraphsql/react- native snippets

multiple states are all rendered together

css can have its own file . make sure to import

in jsx className=clock
