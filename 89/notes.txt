jsx IS NOT HTML AT ALL!!!
 its a react option.
effictint, cuz saved in virtual dom, and only updates with changes
npx- get it without installing it. 
1-npx create react app
run eject script to get out of react scriptd for very sophisticated projects
a function can give you tonz of jsx to render
components js html and data and veiw pacgaged up to one reusable cimoonent
function ans class use capital
class extends react.cimpononeb=tnts
info flows down, kids cant change  it. name=joe
state 8:27
lifecycle motheod
componentDidMount() to dom,  its show time
componentWillUnmount() going away

if just making a state, you x need a constructor
its life is onky as long as it there, if unmounts, its dead. you''ll get a new one
es7 react/reduxgraphsql/react- native snippets

multiple states are all rendered together

css can have its own file . make sure to import

in jsx className=clock
once brought into browser, can be used anywhere
aslo inline css in tag. do style={{background-color:'green'}} its an object
 if list of stuf and takea way first, know that only first changed, so withh list pass in keys, so they just see if keys are same
way more efficient. key can use index- map goved you index (thingy, index,wholearray)
