onClick= call function
issue is with this, if you get a funtion (w/o invoking it), when you csll function you x have the this 8:55 to 859
idea a: so you can  bind the click to this. this.handler = this.handler.bind(this.handle)
idea b: bind it when you pass it to him 902 this.handler.bind(this)
 idea a is better cuz only happends once, intstead of every time it render 
idea c: use arrow function()=> this.handleClick. cuz rules of arrow functions is that the arrow IS this
idea d: experimental fetute if the this is an arrow function by the top 908. called handling events.
x always help like at 928, if you want to pass in a parrameter

0 is false, so undefined

child x updates parent state.
more tools, extensions, add react devlopers toold**
SO do this.props.counter.count=this.props.counter.count+1
so put this function to pare t. dont change parent state yourself, rather use 2 funccytions like at 1036
