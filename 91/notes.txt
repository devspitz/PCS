more react stuff
-either .bind this/ arrow function
.includes returns true or false----make sure its a String
//falls through . makes eslint let  defulat in switch
gow to move sstae to the parent levek.. put in App.js 848 and pass into kids
.reduce
redux- containers where state lives

propType(shortcut = ipt) look at dicumentation
.shape vs .exact

forms:
input vs state issue 950
so set value to state
error: its read only, cuz while u type,i,its being overwriiteen by state,
so you needa listen to change and set that to state, so onChange(handleNameChange)
handleNameChange (e)....this.setState
called controlled compoment. 
there is such thing as uncontrolled component. basically same as dom way.can read docs
do it like this cal react way is cuz model is the truth, not the dom
onSubmit=.....e.prevent default

and use thier solutuion, but you need to do a name in the inputs. same as whichever one. its using square brackets by using the Array Style notation potus[first]
also selcted(dropdown list) also have values, so you can use this syntax.
with value, you needa start off with something,c uz null is nithing. empty string is not considered mepty
SO name:' ';
onBlur vs onChaange??? 1022
watch whole example 1020
NEED INTIAL STATE!!!!
when you type, your one behind, cuz its a aysnc function, so you need await

another lifeCycle function componentaDidUpdate
(zip.length, not zip===0)

92:
makes code shine!!!!!!!!!!
make code immutable, instead of updating objects, you make newones, and throw old ones away.
can use libraries like immer or cricket or do it ourselves
so if state==== old ste newprops===oldpropd
immjutable js, you x needa rerender
use shouldComponentOpen
make everything pureComponent.
either all or none sould be immutable
Object.freeze()...8:25. it wil throw an errror if you try to break anything.

HOOKS
y? x need classses
hard to reuse 
not so hard to explain
850
state hook
import useState
useState()
can use objects, but u can be blowing away part of it, so use state.variable, so ur x replacing a part of it.
or you can lso pass in the 2nd part of the object, by itself setState(soa ll therse thingymijigs, var2)
or you can spread existing state, and change only one part. ...state
also effect hook. caled more often then class, this cjanhgnges after everything happens.
random, but cool is document.title
has lefecycle functons
useEffect
if only want it to run sometimes, use optimization(cuz has issue of not working) u san pass in a second param, and if it canges, useEffect will run. aka you control it with a ependecy array, if do epmpy array, nothing will happen ever-but same as Component did mou nnt
cacn yuse areturn 9:42
clean up.  y see 945, you end up writing code, so no mistakes
---Example using a form with UseEffect 9:49
